Hi, I’m Hong Bin.

I’m passionate about coding and artificial intelligence, and this website is where I document my learning journey. Writing about these topics helps me deepen my understanding and refine my skills.

Beyond that, I also hope to connect with like-minded people who share an interest in coding and AI. If you’re exploring these areas too, feel free to reach out to me or leave a comment under my posts—I’d love to exchange ideas and grow together!
