Hi, I'm Hong Bin. I'm passionate about coding and artificial intelligence, and this website serves as a space where I document my learning journey. Writing about these topics helps me deepen my understanding, and I also hope to connect with like-minded people who share an interest in coding and AI. If you're exploring these areas too, feel free to join the discussion—I’d love to exchange ideas and grow together!
