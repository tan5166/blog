## Problem Description

Given array of strings `nums` containing `n` unique binary strings of length `n`, return *a binary string of length* `n` *that **does not appear** in* `nums`.



## Intuition

- This can be done by Cantor's diagonal argument, so, we just implement it.

## Approach

1. We observe that `nums` is an array containing `n` different binary strings, each of length `n`.

2. To generate a new string that is guaranteed to be unique:

     - We traverse the diagonal elements of `nums` (i.e. `nums[i][i]`).

     - If `nums[i][i]` is '$0$', we change it to '$1$'.
       
       If `nums[i][i]` is '$1$', we change it to '$0$'.

3. Since our new string differs from `nums[i]` at the i-th position, it cannot be identical to any of the given binary strings.

## Code

```c++
string findDifferentBinaryString(vector<string>& nums) {
        string result = "";
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++){
            result += (nums[i][i] == '0') ? '1' : '0';
        }
        return result;
    }
```

Time Complexity: $O(n)$

Space Complexity: $O(1)$ as we doesn't count answer as part of space.
