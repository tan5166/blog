## Problem Description

Given a binary tree with the following rules:

1. `root.val == 0`
2. For any `treeNode`:
   1. If `treeNode.val` has a value `x` and `treeNode.left != null`, then `treeNode.left.val == 2 * x + 1`
   2. If `treeNode.val` has a value `x` and `treeNode.right != null`, then `treeNode.right.val == 2 * x + 2`

Now the binary tree is contaminated, which means all `treeNode.val` have been changed to `-1`.

Implement the `FindElements` class:

- `FindElements(TreeNode* root)` Initializes the object with a contaminated binary tree and recovers it.
- `bool find(int target)` Returns `true` if the `target` value exists in the recovered binary tree.



## Intuition

1. We traverse all the nodes of the tree and update their values to satisfy the constraints given in the problem.
2. After modifying the values, we store them in a hash map to keep track of which values exist in the tree.



## Code

```c++
class FindElements {
    private:
        unordered_map<int, bool> exist;
        void dfs(TreeNode* root, int val){
            if(!root){
                return;
            }
            else{
                root->val = val;
                exist[val] = true;
            }
            dfs(root->left, 2 * val + 1);
            dfs(root->right, 2 * val + 2);
        }

    public:
        FindElements(TreeNode* root) {
            dfs(root, 0);
        }
        
        bool find(int target) {
            return exist[target];
        }
};
```
